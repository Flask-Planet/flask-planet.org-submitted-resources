## How to submit a resource for inclusion on the flask-planet.org website:

Fork this repo, then add a folder on the root with the Title of your resource. Then add your markdown files in the folder, here's an example of the folder structure.

```
flask-planet.org-submitted-resources/
    Already Added Resource Folder/
    My Title of The Resouce/
        __author__.md
        summary.md
        this_page.md
        another_page.md
    Another Already Added Resource/...
```

`__author__.md`
```
Author Name: Your Name Here
Author URI: https://...
```
`summary.md`
```
Will contain a summary of what the resource covers
```

All other pages from here will be guides. If your pages have to be in order number them in the folder.
